# Week 3: Introduction to Python Programming

## Overview
Welcome to Week 3! This week, we'll begin our journey into programming with Python. Python is a powerful yet beginner-friendly programming language that we'll use to control our Raspberry Pi projects throughout this course.

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this week, students will be able to:
- Understand what Python is and why it's popular for Raspberry Pi projects
- Write and run basic Python programs on their Raspberry Pi
- Use variables to store and manipulate different types of data
- Perform calculations using basic operators
- Get input from users and display output
- Make simple decisions using if statements

## Topics Covered
1. **Introduction to Python**
   - What is Python?
   - Why Python for Raspberry Pi?
   - Running Python programs

2. **Variables and Data Types**
   - Creating variables
   - Naming rules and conventions
   - Numbers (integers and floats)
   - Strings (text)
   - Booleans (True/False)

3. **Basic Operators**
   - Arithmetic operators (+, -, *, /, //, %, **)
   - Comparison operators (==, !=, <, >, <=, >=)
   - Basic logic operators (and, or, not)

4. **Input and Output**
   - Using print() to display information
   - Using input() to get user input
   - Formatting output

5. **Basic Control Flow**
   - Simple if statements
   - if-else statements
   - Basic if-elif-else chains

## Materials Needed
- Raspberry Pi (set up from Week 1)
- Monitor, keyboard, and mouse
- Power supply
- Internet connection (optional, for updates)

## Class Structure
- **Lecture/Demo**: 45-60 minutes
- **Hands-on Activities**: 30-45 minutes
- **Review and Q&A**: 15 minutes

## Files in This Week's Folder
- `README.md` - This file, overview of the week
- `QUICK-START.md` - Fast reference guide for students
- `INSTRUCTOR-GUIDE.md` - Teaching notes and tips
- `lecture/` - Detailed lecture notes and examples
- `activities/` - In-class group activities
- `resources/` - Additional learning materials
- `week03-homework.md` - Take-home practice assignments

## Getting Started
1. Make sure your Raspberry Pi is powered on and you're logged in
2. Open the Terminal application
3. We'll be using Python 3 (which comes pre-installed on Raspberry Pi OS)
4. Test that Python is working by typing: `python3 --version`

## Key Concepts to Remember
- **Programming** is giving instructions to a computer
- **Python** is the language we use to write those instructions
- **Variables** are like labeled boxes that hold information
- **Data types** tell the computer what kind of information we're storing
- **Programs execute line by line**, from top to bottom

## Tips for Success
- Don't worry about memorizing everything - practice is key!
- Make mistakes! They're how we learn
- Type the code yourself rather than copy-pasting
- Experiment by changing values and seeing what happens
- Ask questions when something doesn't make sense

## Looking Ahead
Next week (Week 4), we'll expand on these basics and start using Python to control GPIO pins and interact with physical components!

**Note**: All code examples in this week use Python 3. When running programs from the terminal, use `python3` instead of just `python`.
