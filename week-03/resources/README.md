## How to Use These Resources

### For Students

**Before Class**:
- Skim through the cheat sheet to get familiar with syntax
- Don't worry about memorizing everything

**During Class**:
- Keep the cheat sheet handy for reference
- Refer to specific sections as needed
- Focus on understanding, not memorization

**During Activities/Homework**:
- Use the cheat sheet to check syntax
- Use the errors guide when you get stuck
- Try to solve problems yourself first, then reference

**When Debugging**:
1. Read the error message
2. Look up that error type in the errors reference
3. Follow the debugging steps
4. Ask for help if still stuck

### For Instructors

**Preparation**:
- Print copies of the cheat sheet for students
- Have the errors guide available digitally
- Review both before teaching

**During Class**:
- Reference cheat sheet when introducing concepts
- Use errors guide for debugging demonstrations
- Encourage students to use these independently

**After Class**:
- Point students to these resources for homework help
- Use examples from errors guide in future lessons

## Tips for Using These Resources Effectively

### Don't Try to Memorize Everything
- Programming is about problem-solving, not memorization
- It's okay to look things up constantly
- Even experienced programmers use references

### Practice is Key
- Reading alone won't make you a programmer
- Type code yourself, don't just copy
- Experiment and make mistakes
- Try to solve problems before looking at solutions

### Build Good Habits Early
- Use the cheat sheet until syntax becomes natural
- Learn to read error messages rather than just copy code
- Comment your code as you write it
- Test frequently rather than writing lots of code at once

### Ask Questions
- No question is too basic
- If you're confused, others probably are too
- Use these resources to help form specific questions
- "I got a NameError on line 5" is better than "It doesn't work"

## Customizing Your Learning

### If You're Struggling
- Focus on the cheat sheet examples
- Type them out exactly, then modify slightly
- Work through examples slowly
- Ask for help early, before frustration builds
- Pair up with classmates

### If You're Moving Quickly
- Try the challenge problems
- Explore topics not covered (loops, lists, functions)
- Help other students (teaching reinforces learning)
- Create your own projects
- Look into Python libraries

## Week 3 Learning Goals Checklist

Use this to track your progress:

**Basic Syntax** □
- [ ] I can create variables with appropriate names
- [ ] I understand different data types (int, float, str, bool)
- [ ] I can use print() to display information
- [ ] I know how to add comments to my code

**Input and Math** □
- [ ] I can get input from users
- [ ] I can convert input to numbers
- [ ] I can perform basic calculations (+, -, *, /)
- [ ] I understand operator precedence (PEMDAS)

**Decision Making** □
- [ ] I can write if statements with correct syntax
- [ ] I understand how to use elif and else
- [ ] I can use comparison operators (==, !=, <, >, etc.)
- [ ] I know how to use proper indentation

**Debugging** □
- [ ] I can read Python error messages
- [ ] I know the most common errors
- [ ] I have a strategy for debugging
- [ ] I'm not afraid of making mistakes

---

## Quick Help Lookup

**Common Issues**:
- "My code won't run" → Check for SyntaxError (missing colons, quotes)
- "Variable not found" → Check for NameError (typo, created variable?)
- "Can't add string and number" → Check for TypeError (convert with int/float)
- "Code not executing" → Check for IndentationError (4 spaces after if)
- "Wrong answer in calculations" → Check operator precedence (use parentheses)

**Quick Syntax Reminders**:
- Get number: `age = int(input("Age: "))`
- Print with variable: `print(f"You are {age} years old")`
- If statement: `if condition:` (don't forget colon!)
- Check if equal: `if x == 5:` (two equals signs!)
- Compare numbers: `<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`, `==`, `!=`

---

## Practice Suggestions

**Daily Practice** (10-15 minutes):
- Modify one of the examples from class
- Try a problem from the homework
- Experiment with a concept you found confusing

**Weekly Challenge**:
- Create a program that solves a real problem for you
- Ideas: Homework tracker, favorite game scorer, allowance calculator

**Before Next Week**:
- Complete all required homework programs
- Attempt at least one challenge program
- Review any concepts you found difficult
- Make sure you can explain variables, input, and if statements

## Getting the Most from Week 3

Week 3 is your foundation for everything else in this course. The time you invest now in understanding these basics will pay off every week going forward. 

**Success Strategy**:
1. Attend class and participate actively
2. Complete activities during class time
3. Start homework early (not the night before!)
4. Use these resources when stuck
5. Ask questions without hesitation
6. Practice beyond just the assignments

**Remember**: Every programmer started exactly where you are. The difference between beginners and experts is just practice and persistence!
