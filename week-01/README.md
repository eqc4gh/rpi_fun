# Week 1: Introduction to Computing & Environment Setup

## Overview
Students will learn fundamental computer concepts, understand the components of a Raspberry Pi, and successfully set up their first Linux environment.

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this week, students will be able to:
1. Identify and explain the function of major computer components
2. Understand what makes Raspberry Pi unique
3. Safely handle and connect Raspberry Pi hardware
4. Install Raspberry Pi OS on a microSD card
5. Boot their Raspberry Pi for the first time
6. Navigate the basic desktop environment

## Materials Needed
- Raspberry Pi 4 (per student)
- MicroSD card (32GB minimum)
- Power supply (USB-C, 5V/3A)
- Micro-HDMI to HDMI cable
- USB keyboard and mouse
- Monitor with HDMI input
- Computer with SD card reader (for imaging)

- Practical: Change desktop wallpaper and open File Manager

## Homework/Extension
- Write a one-paragraph reflection: "What surprised you most about the Raspberry Pi?"
- (Optional) Research: Find one interesting project made with Raspberry Pi online
- Practice: Safely shut down and restart your Raspberry Pi 3 times

## Resources
- Official Raspberry Pi Getting Started Guide
- Video: "What is a Raspberry Pi?" (linked in resources/)
- Diagram: Raspberry Pi 4 component map
- Safety guidelines poster

## Troubleshooting Common Issues
See `resources/troubleshooting-week-01.md` for solutions to common first-time setup problems.

## Next Week Preview
Week 2 will introduce the Linux terminal and basic command-line operations. Students should be comfortable with their Raspberry Pi desktop environment before moving forward.
