# Week 1 Instructor Guide

Quick reference for teaching Week 1 of the Raspberry Pi course.

---

## Pre-Class Preparation

### Materials Check (per student)
- [ ] Raspberry Pi 4 (4GB recommended)
- [ ] MicroSD card (32GB, Class 10+, pre-imaged OR students will image in class)
- [ ] USB-C power supply (5V/3A minimum)
- [ ] Micro-HDMI to HDMI cable
- [ ] USB keyboard
- [ ] USB mouse
- [ ] Monitor with HDMI input

### Room Setup
- [ ] Tables arranged for small groups (2-3 students)
- [ ] Power strips/outlets accessible
- [ ] Monitors positioned for easy viewing
- [ ] Instructor display/projector ready
- [ ] Extra keyboards/mice for backups
- [ ] First aid kit accessible
- [ ] Fire extinguisher noted (just in case!)

### Pre-Class Decision
**Option A**: Pre-image all SD cards (saves 10-15 minutes)
**Option B**: Students image their own (more learning, takes longer)

**Recommendation**: For first class, pre-image to maximize hands-on time with hardware.

## Differentiation Strategies

### For Advanced Students
- Complete exploration activities faster
- Try terminal commands preview
- Help peers (carefully monitored)
- Start homework extension activities
- Research interesting projects

### For Struggling Students
- Partner with supportive peer
- Break tasks into smaller steps
- Use visual guides more heavily
- Extra instructor attention
- Simplified vocabulary
- Focus on core concepts only

### For Students with Disabilities
**Visual impairments**:
- Increase text size in OS
- Use high-contrast themes
- Verbal descriptions of visuals
- Tactile exploration of hardware

**Motor skill challenges**:
- Adaptive keyboards/mice available
- Extra time for connections
- Peer assistance for physical tasks
- Focus on software concepts

**Learning differences**:
- Written + verbal instructions
- Extra processing time
- Repeat key concepts
- More frequent check-ins
- Visual checklists

## Assessment Points

### Formative Assessment (During Class)

**Observable Skills**:
- [ ] Handles hardware carefully and safely
- [ ] Follows multi-step instructions
- [ ] Troubleshoots basic problems independently
- [ ] Asks relevant questions
- [ ] Helps peers appropriately
- [ ] Engages with material

**Quick Checks**:
- "Point to the CPU on your Pi"
- "Show me how to shut down properly"
- "What does RAM do?"
- "Why do we use an SD card?"

### Summative Assessment (Homework)
- Properly completed power cycle log
- Reflection essay completeness
- Component diagram accuracy
- File organization

## Common Misconceptions

### Address These Explicitly:

❌ **"Raspberry Pi is a toy/not a real computer"**
✓ It's a full computer, just smaller and cheaper

❌ **"Linux is too hard to use"**
✓ Modern Linux (like RPi OS) is user-friendly

❌ **"I might break it by clicking wrong things"**
✓ Software mistakes are fixable; hardware needs care

❌ **"I need to know programming first"**
✓ We'll learn programming together

❌ **"It's just like Windows/Mac"**
✓ Similar concepts, but different interface and capabilities

❌ **"The SD card is like a USB drive"**
✓ It's the permanent storage - entire OS is on it!

---

## Safety Reminders

### Emphasize Throughout Class:

**Electrical Safety**:
- Never connect/disconnect while powered
- Water and electronics don't mix
- Use proper power supply
- Don't touch pins while powered

**Physical Safety**:
- Handle by edges
- Don't force connections
- Be aware of sharp corners
- Work on non-conductive surface

**Data Safety**:
- Save work frequently
- Proper shutdown protects SD card
- Backup important files

## Troubleshooting During Class

### Quick Fixes

**No Display**:
1. Check monitor input source
2. Try other HDMI port
3. Verify power LED is on
4. Check cable connections

**Keyboard/Mouse Not Working**:
1. Try different USB port
2. Check connection is firm
3. Use USB 3.0 (blue) ports
4. Test different device

**Won't Boot**:
1. Check SD card is inserted fully
2. Verify power supply is adequate
3. Look at LED patterns
4. Try re-imaging SD card

**Too Slow**:
1. Wait 2-3 minutes after first boot
2. Close unnecessary programs
3. Check Task Manager
4. May need better SD card

### When to Re-image
- Boot loops or freezes
- Corrupted OS errors
- Inexplicable slow performance
- Major configuration errors
- Student requests fresh start

### Group Activities:
- Component identification race
- Troubleshooting scenarios
- "What would you build?" brainstorm
- Compare Pi to other computers

## Reflection Questions (For Instructor)

After teaching Week 1, consider:

1. Did students achieve learning objectives?
2. Was the pacing appropriate?
3. Which explanations resonated best?
4. What caused the most confusion?
5. How can I improve for next time?
6. Were all students engaged?
7. Do materials need updating?

**Teaching is iterative - improve with each session!**
